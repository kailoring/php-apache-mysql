# Choice of database

#Status: accepted

#Context:

MySQL is an open source relational database management system. This will be used to implement a database for managing users.

#Decision:

MySQL is the chosen database application to use due to how simple it is to structure and add data for a database system. I also have relative experience with MySQL from a prior course. CRUD, commonly referred to as Create, Read, Update, and Delete procedures are implemented into this application by allowing forms to retrieve and return data from the database. ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are not (yet) entirely necessary for this application due to the simplicity of it's functions. Therefore, the primary focus revolves around working CRUD ability. 


#Consequences:

Little effort is needed to implement and update the database system.
